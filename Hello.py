 Time series clustering poses a significant challenge with diverse applications across domains. 
 A prominent drawback of existing solutions lies in their limited interpretability, often confined 
 to presenting users with centroids. In addressing this gap, our work presents in this demo $k$-Graph, an 
 unsupervised method explicitly crafted to augment interpretability in time series clustering.
